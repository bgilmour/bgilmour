### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bruce Gilmour, I hail from Scotland (the coldest but most beautiful part of the British Isles), and I've been a professional software engineer for more years than I care to remember. I've worked in all sorts of areas including:

- Defence & Aerospace (air traffic control simulation)
- Oil & Gas (reservoir and flow simulation)
- Datacomms (fault finding and traffic analysis)
- Telecoms (quality of service monitoring and analytics)
- Finance (everything from handheld terminals to back office stock info systems to full end to end banking suites)

Right now I work for a FinTech and my focus is mainly on providing a REST framework and the tooling to make it accessible to internal and external users.

I mostly write software in Java and PL/SQL these days but I also have an interest in functional programming with Haskell and, more recently, have started looking at Apple's iOS and macOS platforms using Swift and SwiftUI.

You can find me on Twitter as [@bgilmour](https://twitter.com/bgilmour) but be aware that my language there can be somewhat fruity at times ðŸ˜„
